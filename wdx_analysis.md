Global population growth leads to overpopulation, causing scarcity of natural resources of the Earth. Population is growth is influenced by multiple factors like evolved health care, better and safe urban infrastructures. It makes life unsustainable in areas with dense populations.
Advanced innovations in the fields of science and health care have made life on Earth long-lasting. Despite these phenomenal results, it has also led to overpopulation which in turn affects the consumption of natural resources for energy generation. Modern innovations ranging from automobiles to semiconductor devices demand energy sources in form of electricity or fuels. 

Fossil fuels are the most prominent natural resources for the production of energy. Increasing populations require higher production of energy for everyday activities and this demands consumption of fossil fuels like coal and crude oil. Despite the production of hydroelectricity, the majority proportion of energy generated is from fossil fuels. 
Continued usage of energy and electronic devices have affected carbon emission leading to the greenhouse effect on Earth. Greenhouse gases cause global warming which disrupts the environmental conditions creating chaos that could lead to devastating situations.

Let us analyze the effects of overpopulation on the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions with the data from the time period of 2010 to 2020.

## Approach

**a.	Source of data & graphs:** THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER (https://www.worlddev.xyz/) 

**b.	Countries Compared:** United States, India, United Arab Emirates, Japan, United Kingdom, China, Singapore, Congo, Dem. Rep.

**c.	Timeline :** 2010 to 2020

**d.	Topics and Indicators:**

-	**Urban Development** : Population density (people per sq. km of land area)
- **Science & Technology** : High-technology exports (% of manufactured exports)
- **Energy & Mining** : Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
- **Energy & Mining** : Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)
- **Climate Change** : Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)

## Population distribution among countries:

## How is tech exports and electricity consumption affected by population?

### **High-tech exports**

### **Renewable Energy Consumptions**

### **Relation between population density and high-technology exports**

- The graph clearly states that Singapore has got highest technological exports which insinuates to the demand of high energy resources.


### **Relation between population density and Renewable Energy Consumption**

- The graph shows that renewable energy consumption ratios need not be dependent on population density, as congo, the nation with lower population density has highest renewable energy consumption when compared to other nations.

### **Relation between Renewable Energy Consumption and Greenhouse gas emission**

- It can be clearly observed that the China has got highest greenhouse gas emission when compared to other nations followed by India. Though Singapore has highest population density when compared to China, China has greater emission of CO<sub>2</sub> gas. This could insinuate that land size also matters when comming to emission of greeenhouse gas.

## How is fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gasses emission affected with changes in population and time?

## Observations 

- It can be observed that as time passes the population density increases
- As population density increases the consumption of renewable energy increases
- Consumption of renewable energy is affected by the increase in trade of high-tech exports.
- Consumpiton of fossil fuels increase with increase in population
- Emission of greenhouse gasses increases with increase in nation's land size and is slightly affected by the populatio density.


## Conclusion

Although it is inevitably true that it is not possible to determine 100% facts from just one indicator like population to declare fossil fuel extinction and increase in greenhouse gasses is solely due to population growth as many other factors like current environmental situaltions, climatic conditions could also be the reasons.

For future researches, comparing the changes in fossil fuel consumption and green house gas generation with other factors other than population would provide much more analytics and much more meaningful insights.
