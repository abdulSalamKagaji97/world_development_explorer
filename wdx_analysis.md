Global population growth leads to overpopulation, causing scarcity of natural resources of the Earth. Population is growth is influenced by multiple factors like evolved health care, better and safe urban infrastructures. It makes life unsustainable in areas with dense populations.
Advanced innovations in the fields of science and health care have made life on Earth long-lasting. Despite these phenomenal results, it has also led to overpopulation which in turn affects the consumption of natural resources for energy generation. Modern innovations ranging from automobiles to semiconductor devices demand energy sources in form of electricity or fuels. 

Fossil fuels are the most prominent natural resources for the production of energy. Increasing populations require higher production of energy for everyday activities and this demands consumption of fossil fuels like coal and crude oil. Despite the production of hydroelectricity, the majority proportion of energy generated is from fossil fuels. 
Continued usage of energy and electronic devices have affected carbon emission leading to the greenhouse effect on Earth. Greenhouse gases cause global warming which disrupts the environmental conditions creating chaos that could lead to devastating situations.

Let us analyze the effects of overpopulation on the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions with the data from the time period of 2010 to 2020.

## Approach

**a.	Source of data & graphs:** THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER (https://www.worlddev.xyz/) 

**b.	Countries Compared:** United States, India, United Arab Emirates, Japan, United Kingdom, China, Singapore, Congo, Dem. Rep.

**c.	Timeline :** 2010 to 2020

**d.	Topics and Indicators:**

-	**Urban Development** : Population density (people per sq. km of land area)
- **Science & Technology** : High-technology exports (% of manufactured exports)
- **Energy & Mining** : Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
- **Energy & Mining** : Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)
- **Climate Change** : Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)
